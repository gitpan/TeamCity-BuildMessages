=head1 NAME

TeamCity::BuildMessages - Encode and emit messages that TeamCity can interpret during a build.


=head1 VERSION

This document describes TeamCity::BuildMessages version 0.999.1.


=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use TeamCity::BuildMessages qw< :all >;

    my $escaped = teamcity_escape('stuff with weird characters');

    teamcity_emit_build_message('messageName', 'value');
    teamcity_emit_build_message(
        'messageName',
        parameterName => 'parameter value',
    );
    teamcity_emit_build_message('messageName', %parameters);


=head1 DESCRIPTION

The code in this module is based upon the documentation at
L<http://www.jetbrains.net/confluence/display/TCD3/Build+Script+Interaction+with+TeamCity>.


=head1 INTERFACE

Nothing is exported by default, but you can import everything using the
C<:all> tag.


=over

=item C<teamcity_escape($text)>

Returns a version of the parameter with TeamCity escapes applied to it, e.g.
C<\n> becomes C<|n>.


=item C<teamcity_emit_build_message($message_name, $parameter_value)> or C<< teamcity_emit_build_message($message_name, parameter1 => 'value1', parameter2 => 'value2', ...) >>

Writes a message to STDOUT in a form that TeamCity can understand.  See the
TeamCity documentation for valid messages.


=back


=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over

=item No message specified.

C<teamcity_emit_build_message()> was called without a C<$message_name>
parameter.


=item No values specified.

C<teamcity_emit_build_message()> was called without any message values.


=item "%s" is not a valid message name.

C<teamcity_emit_build_message()> was called with a <$message_name> parameter
that didn't consist of a letter or underscore followed by any number of
alphanumerics and underscores.


=item Message parameter given without a value.

C<teamcity_emit_build_message()> was called with an odd number of parameter
values.  If there is more than one value given, each value must have a name,
e.g. this is wrong:

    teamcity_emit_build_message('message', 'one', 'two', 'three');


=item "%s" is not a valid property name.

C<teamcity_emit_build_message()> was called with a property name that didn't
consist of a letter or underscore followed by any number of alphanumerics and
underscores.
